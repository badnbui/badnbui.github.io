My name is Marcus Bui, I am currently a Junior majoring in Management Information Systems and Marketing at the Shidler College of Business at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. I was born and raised here on Oahu, and attended Kalani High School. I'm a first generation Asian American in my family, whereas my parents originate from Vietnam. Some of my hobbies/interests include photography, sports, and the business club I'm on board for, the American Marketing Association. 

The reason I chose to major in Management Information Systems is because I have always had an interest in the realm of technology, but also appreciated the nuances of business, such as networking, communication, and things in that nature. Thus, when I stumbled upon the major of MIS and heard great things about it from my peers, I felt like it was perfect for me. I'm truly excited to finally take my first MIS related course at Shidler!
