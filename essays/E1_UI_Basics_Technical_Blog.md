  When it came to the "Workouts of the Day", I truthfully wasn't very excited to do them and have to record myself. However, after simply doing the first one, I actually really enjoyed completing it; it was satisfying to not only code, but to finish it within the RX time frame. As I worked on each WOD, I began to formulate my own way of learning. My way featured watching the screencast at 1.5 speed (regular speed was a little too slow for me personally), attempting the WOD one time through without stopping, and then re-doing the WODs until I got stuck again. Once I got stuck, I would simply find the solution through the screencast and redo the WOD.
  
  For BrowserHistory1, I honestly didn't really know where to start so I just fiddled with the code for a little, but caved and watched the screencast. It was fascinating to see all these lines of text work together to create a webpage. I had a relatively easy time remembering most of the code to input, such as the Emmet abbreviation, the subsections, and headers. I ran into a problem when I had to remember the code to connect an image into the .html (<img width=__ height=__ src=___>). However, I quickly remembered it and started the WOD over again. The next portion that challenged me was creating the list and referencing the list using the <href code. Initially, I didn't understand the referencing and how it worked, but it wasn't too difficult to figure out. Overall, the first WOD took me about 3 tries to complete within the RX time frame.
  
  In my opinion, BrowserHistory2 was the easiest to complete. Inserting the reference for the .CSS stylesheet and then adding the formatting within the .CSS file was simple, thank you partially to VS Code for assisting by filling in blanks for code! The most confusing part to me was inserting the fonts via Google because the link you need to reference isn't directly on the ITM 352 page, but it can be found within the screencast. Otherwise, this WOD was fun and simple, but still took me 3 tries.
  
  Lastly, BrowserHistory3 was also relatively simple, but I struggled with placement of the code for the navbar and the <ul>. Other than that, changing the format of the webpage into columns and making the table of contents into a horizontal navbar wasn't all too difficult. This WOD specifically helped me realize how exact the placement of code must be and has definitely opened my eyes to the endless possibilities of mistakes that can be made coding. Be careful!!! This WOD also took me 3 tries to complete within the RX time frame.
  
  Upon completion of the first three Workouts of the Day, I grew to enjoy doing them more, and I also feel that I definitely have a better understanding of the class and new concepts that arise within the class. These WODs are a great way to actively practice/train my programming skills, and I look forward to what this course has to offer me next in the realm of coding!
